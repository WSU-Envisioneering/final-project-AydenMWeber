                <li>Around 250 BC, Archimedes (a prominent Greek mathematician) invented an algorithm to approximate pi with any amount of accuracy (though it was quite tedious and time-consuming).</li>
                <li>Around 4000 AD, mathematicians in both China and India figured out a way to approximate pi (independently from Archimedes' discovery) up to both 7 and 5 digits respectively, using geometrical methods.</li>
                <li>A thousand years later, the first computational formula for pi was invented.</li>
                <li>Then, in 1706, the symbol for pi (the greek letter Ï€) was established by a Welsh mathematician named William Jones.</li>
