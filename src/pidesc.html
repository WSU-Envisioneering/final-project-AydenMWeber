            <p>Pi (Ï€) is usually defined as the ratio of any circle's circumference to its diameter (C/d)</p>
            <p>The ratio is the exact same for all circles, even if the sizes are different.</p>
            <p>It is an irrational number, meaning that it can't be written as the ratio of two integers</p>
            <p>(numbers that aren't fractions). Although pi's digits seem to have no pattern and have passed tests</p>
            <p>for normality (each number being equally likely to appear), this has not been proven.</p>
